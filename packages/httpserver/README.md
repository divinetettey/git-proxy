# git-proxy-core
This package comprises the core libraries used for Git Proxy services. This includes libraries
for parsing git data for a checked out repository, filters for git actions as well as the main
policy manager functionality.

## API
TBD. This package should be added as a dependency on any component wishing to leverage git-proxy
functionality as a library. It is also used as a transitive dependency for various other
git-proxy components such as the git HTTP server and the built-in plugins.

TODO:
- [ ] Create API docs
