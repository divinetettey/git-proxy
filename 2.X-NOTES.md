# Version 2.x of Git Proxy
These are just a collection of notes which will eventually need to be converted into real documentation. It's not expected that this document lives beyond a couple of branches.

## Project Structure
The new design brings the following new packages. These are NPM packages compiled with TypeScript and dependencies & workspace managed via Yarn 4+.

```
apps/ # Deployable packages of Git Proxy. This replaces the "bin" or original index.js entrypoint into the existing @finos/git-proxy@1.1.0 package
 - standalone/ # @finos/git-proxy-standalone, just the Git proxy server features w/o any dashboard/UI, API or database
 - full/ # @finos/git-proxy, the full suite of services offered when a developer choses to use git-proxy "out of the box" with all the bells & whistles

packages/ # All "core" packages provided by the project.
 - common/ # Core libraries used as a dependency across other packages. Most of the logic with src/proxy/* (outside of Express routers & app) will be moved into this package
 - httpserver/ # Express HTTP proxy setup, routing & request/response handling
 - dashboard/ # Web UI. Management console, dashboard, etc.
 - api/ # REST API for the dashboard and to expose various data populated from the proxy. External integrations should only interact with the database through the API to avoid tight coupling

plugins/ # Plugins maintained by the git-proxy maintainers and samples for others to create their own custom plugins on top of
 - hello-world/
 - template/
```

## Building
With the introduction of TypeScript, each package has to be compiled. Due to some of the existing tooling (testing, etc), this branch is currently transpiling down to CommonJS for maximum compatibility with existing source code. More details can be found in the tsconfig.json.

Installing dependencies is now handled by [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com). Most `npm` commands are re-implemented in `yarn` with some conveniences such as being able to run an arbitrary script by simply executing `yarn <scriptname>` such as `yarn test`. Yarn generates its [own lock file](./yarn.lock) and no longer will package-lock.json be used. There are bound to be numerous workflow & CI changes needed to support this.

### Steps
Install Yarn ([docs](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)):

```bash
corepack enable
```

To install all dependencies:

```
$ yarn install

```

Build a package:

```
yarn <path-to-package> build
```

Build all packages:

```
$ yarn workspaces foreach -A run build
[@finos/git-proxy-standalone]: Process started
[@finos/git-proxy-standalone]: Process exited (exit code 0), completed in 0s 673ms

[@finos/git-proxy-common]: Process started
[@finos/git-proxy-common]: Process exited (exit code 0), completed in 0s 916ms

[@finos/git-proxy-httpserver]: Process started
[@finos/git-proxy-httpserver]: Process exited (exit code 0), completed in 0s 733ms
Done in 2s 332ms
```

Run an executable package:

```bash
yarn apps/standalone start
```

## Existing source
Where possible, the existing source code that was implemented on older Node versions and using CommonJS is being retained in the new packages. However, gradual introduction of TypeScript type checking is being added. This allows reusing most of the existing logic while gaining type safety & sanity on all the various operations that Git Proxy already does such as inspecting the HTTP payload, reading from config or databases and acting on push requests.
